# Definition of done
- The code has been formatted witn rustfmt
- The code 'passes' a check by the rust-clippy linter
- The code is sufficiently automatically tested
  - Every acceptance criterion for a user story is checked by a test
  - Code coverage  at least 60%

# Git branching
- 'main' branch contains only code meeting the definition of done
- All active development happens in separate feature branches
- Feature branches are merged into main once done
  - Aim to have feature branches last a maximum of 8 work hours before being merged into main
